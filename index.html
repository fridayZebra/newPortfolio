        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Firoz (fee-rose) and I'm a Frontend Engineer out of Anaheim, CA. I wanted to build applications that weren't being
          built, solve problems that weren't being solved and be challenged (and frustrated) every day. So, I left my life
          in investment finance and found a new home in web development.</p>
        <p>I haven't been doing this very long, but can already say that it's the best decision I've ever made. I LOVE making
          things efficient- from simple things like teaching people keyboard short cuts to automating processes. Interests:Octopuses(trust
          me, it's not octopi), scuba diving, snow-kiting, sailing...really anything with the ocean. If I'm not in front
          of the computer, I'm usually on the water
